Commons Helpers
===============
A collection of helpful Scala Implicits and Utilities.

## Motivation

After a few years of programming in Scala, I've identified a small collection of helper classes that I tend to copy
from one project to another; thus, I've decided to move these into their own project so that they can be easily re-used
in multiple projects.
